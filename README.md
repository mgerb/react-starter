# Starter project for React
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React 16](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
- [Webpack 3](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## Commands
- yarn install
- yarn start

http://localhost:8080

## Note
There is currently a bug with yarn not updating package.json when upgrading packages. 
[See more here](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2042#issuecomment-269601927). 
I added the `update-latest` script in package.json for a temporary fix.
