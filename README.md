# Starter project for React
A simplified starter project for react/typescript.

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React 16](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
- [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [open-color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/)

## Commands
- npm install
- npm start

http://localhost:8080

### TODO:
- Fix extract-text-webpack-plugin
Currently getting an error due to the webpack 4 upgrade.
Everything still seems fine though.
```
Entrypoint undefined = extract-text-webpack-plugin-output-filename
```

- use favicons-webpack-plugin when it's ready for Webpack 4
  - currently using [webapp-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webapp-webpack-plugin)
